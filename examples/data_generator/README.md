# Sample Data Generator

## Links

- [Online JSON Schema Validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/)

## Idea

Main aim is to generate a project schema-valid data

- An example of data is presented in file `data.json`
- An scheme is presented in branch **feature/telemetry**


The generator must also validate JSON data which to be compliant with the scheme

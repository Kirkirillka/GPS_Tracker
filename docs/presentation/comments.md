I think you've planned the presentation for 7 minutes for Magdeburg meeting.
 
However, at the defence you'll have 15-20 mins.
 
Please adapt the presentation accordingly. Also, can you give me please the input data for the K-Means algorithm? 

I'm still strugglling to understand why it gives so strange results, which lay outside of the convex hull, created by UE coordinates.

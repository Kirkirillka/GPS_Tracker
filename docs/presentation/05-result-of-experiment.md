# Result of experiment

In the beginning of group study we set up aims which can give a whole picture about achieved results of the project in general.

From the developed system point of view, it satisfies functional requirements, that is, the UEs connect to AP, AP connect to CnC, data is transferred, collected, and shown in convenient way. For achieving this, some changes in technological stack and architectural decisions had to be made. 

On the other hand, there are non-functional requirements to consider with respect to the system. Particularly, the system is not stable all the time for some reasons. In the current version, performance was not highly prioritized, so it can be improved in future. We put some effort for usability increase (front-end & android app).

From the optimization algorithm point of view, the same two groups of requirements should be tried. In general, optimal positions are suggested properly. On the other hand, the accuracy may be further improved with resources of extra data or even appplying more advanced algorithm.

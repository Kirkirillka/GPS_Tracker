# Final result

We have completed 4 experimental trials. We encountered problems in each experiment attempt.

To sum up, they all relate to:
- Wi-Fi connection: radio link may suer serious collisions that influence data transmission.
- Architecture flaws: the initial proposed design did not match the given functional requirement 
and worked incorrectly. Further, we redesign the architecture. It allowed us to run an
experiment correctly, however, there are still gaps to fill in.
- Optimization algorithms: they should go through a formal evaluation to check their correctness
on test data.

Despite these problems, we can conclude that the developed framework can be applied for 
performing UAVs layout optimization, the current version has enough capabilities to provide access 
to investigate and analyze the measured data. The algorithms included in the current version of the
framework have restrictions, simplified and produce biased results, but the contrary can be highly
modified to obtain more reliable results. The framework extensibility allows us to include more
algorithms to optimize UAV positions.

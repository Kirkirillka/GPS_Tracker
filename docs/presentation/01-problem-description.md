# Problem description

The demand of users from mobile communication has been continuously increasing. They need higher throughput, lower latency, more data and services. One tendency for the past years (from 2G to 5G) is to relax pressue on the Macro-cellular level of network and give Micro-cellular level more control and responsibility, therefore to be close to the end users as close as possible to provide light of sight which leads to higher channel quality characteristics. Air access has become a new solution for the development of communications. 

 Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) having an base station (BS) or access point on board that will be located nearly mobile users may provide high quality sink link back to infrastructure and forth to the end users, it can be successful solution to improve capacity and latency.
 
 There are plenty of UAV-BS position planning algorithms. They vary in complexity, amount of data required, accuracy of results and so on. One of the problem unites them is - to proof the correctness of an algorithm it requires to run an physical experiment. 
 
 A complex set of equipment, wise planning, pre- and post- processing of data - there are much more tasks that have to be done in order to successfully test an placement algorithm. There should be a system or a framework that could help engineers and researchers to simplify that kind of work, as well as to provide an unified interface to operate on the data used for positioning.

# Conclusion

Finally, we have obtained a system applicable for base stations position optimization.

All collected data is presented in a form convenient for further analysis.

Any adjustments to the data collected by the system may be easily made, so those data become more reliable.

Basically, the developed system has initially structure to be easily improved/extended

At the same time, problems like unstability in request sending by UEs, rare deny in load speed measurement, etc, still occur.

For wrapping up the working version of the system and easier analysis of obtained data certain simplifications were made.

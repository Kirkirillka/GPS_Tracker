## Why Android?

In the beginning of the group project development it was said that a mobile app for client coordinates transfer would be necessary.

Although there were reasons **against** selecting Android:
- nobody in our team has an experience developing on it

Eventually, we **agreed** upon designing the app on Android platform based on the following reasons:
- two members of our team write on the Java language
- Android mobile operating system has the biggest share on market
- large and developed community
- possibility to involve many UEs to the experiment

## Outcome
- we have got an app which is easy to install and use
- minimum 6 UEs took part in our experiment, not a problem to involve even more
- additional changes to the app may be easily done
- huge opportunities to evolve and enlarge the project

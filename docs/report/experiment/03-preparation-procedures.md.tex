\section{Experiment preparation procedures}\label{experiment-preparation-procedures}

These steps influence experiment parameters. We aim to take into account
environmental conditions and to minimize noise components.


\subsection{Preparation steps}\label{steps}

\subsubsection{Prepare hardware and software bundles}

Early preparation will solve possible problems during real experiment.

\subsubsection{Install \glsentrytext{gps_android} on \glsentrytext{ue}}

Before the experiment, software must be already installed on \gls{android} phones to ensure compatibility.

\subsubsection{Check the weather condition}

Specific environment condition (such as snow or rain) may damage equipment
and disrupt experiment result.

\subsubsection{Check the \glsentrytext{rss} attenuation}

This parameter will influence size of area used to place \glspl{ap} and \glspl{ue}.


\subsubsection{Measure the experiment area and place \glsentrytext{ue} on the field}

In case if \acrshort{rss} is high enough (level of highness evaluated by expert method) there is no reason to use a smaller area
because the radio link quality would remain the same.

# Final Results

We have completed 4 experimental attempts. We encountered problems each attempt, mostly they cover:

- Wi-Fi connection: radio link may suffer serious collisions that drop up data transmission.
- Overcomplicated architecture: the initial proposal architecture is quite sophisticated, but it does not match the given functional requirement. Further, we figured out a possible simplified solution that gave us an opportunity to run experiments correctly, however, there are still gaps to fill in.
- Optimization algorithms: higher accuracy requires additional data to supply and more advanced algorithms to perform. Even so, there should be a strict evaluation of the results they produce if that is correct.

Despite these problems, we can conclude that the developed framework can be applied for performing UAVs layout optimization, the current version has enough capabilities to provide access to investigate and analyze the measured data. The algorithms included in the current version of the framework have restrictions, simplified and produce biased results, but the contrary has an ability to be highly modified to obtain more reliable results. The extensibility of the platform gives the opportunity to extend the current set of optimization algorithms in a simple way.

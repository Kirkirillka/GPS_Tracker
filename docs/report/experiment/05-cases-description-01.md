# Case-1. Suboptimal layout

In the first case **Access Points(APs)** are placed in the ground so that
both of them are in the center of corresponding quarter of 25x25 meters 
and far from all UEs to approximately 25 meters.

**UEs** are left in two groups of three filling the other two quarters respectively.
At the same time, they are not too close to each other in order to not have an interference and absolutely the same conditions.

Finally, **CnC** is set in the middle of the whole 50x50 meters experimental field, 
so that 2 APs and 2 groups of UEs mentioned above are on the same distance.

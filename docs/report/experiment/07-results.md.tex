\section{Final Results}\label{final-results}

We have completed 4 experimental attempts. We encountered problems each
attempt, mostly they cover:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Wi-Fi connection: radio link may suffer serious collisions that drop
  up data transmission.
\item
  Complicated architecture: the initial proposed design is
  quite sophisticated, but it does not match the given functional
  requirement. Further, we figured out a possible simplified solution
  that gave us an opportunity to run experiments correctly, however,
  there are still gaps to fill in.
\item
  Optimization algorithms: higher accuracy requires additional data to
  supply and more advanced algorithms to perform. Even so, there should
  be a strict evaluation of the results they produce if that is correct.
\end{itemize}

Despite these problems, we can conclude that the developed framework can
be applied for performing UAVs layout optimization, the current version
has enough capabilities to provide access to investigate and analyze the
measured data. The algorithms included in the current version of the
framework have restrictions, simplified and produce biased results, but
the contrary has an ability to be highly modified to obtain more
reliable results. The extensibility of the platform gives the
opportunity to extend the current set of optimization algorithms in a
simple way.

\section{Final Results}\label{final-results}

We have completed 4 experimental trials. We encountered problems in each experiment attempt. To sum up, they all relate to:

\begin{itemize}
	\tightlist
	\item
	\gls{wifi} connection: radio link may suffer serious collisions that influence data transmission.
	\item
	Architecture flaws: the initial proposed design did not match the given functional requirement and worked incorrectly. Further, we redesign the architecture. It allowed us to run an experiment correctly, however, there are still gaps to fill in.
	\item
	Optimization algorithms: they should go through a formal evaluation to check their correctness on test data.
\end{itemize}

Despite these problems, we can conclude that the developed framework can be applied for performing \glspl{uav} layout optimization, the current version has enough capabilities to provide access to investigate and analyze the measured data. The algorithms included in the current version of the framework have restrictions, simplified and produce biased results, but the contrary can be highly modified to obtain more reliable results. The framework extensibility allows us to include more algorithms to optimize \gls{uav} positions.

# 3. Experiment preparation procedures.

In this section, we specify the steps to be performed before the main part of the experiment.

These steps influence experiment parameters. We aim to take into account environmental conditions and to minimize noise components.

## Steps

| Step                                                    | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prepare required hardware and software                  | Because the experiment would be complicated from the control point of view, this is required to prepare and automate as much as possible |
| Pre-install GPS_Android on UEs                           | Before the experiment, the software must be on Android phones already to ensure there is no incompatibility                              |
| Check the weather                                       | Specific weather condition (such as snow or rain) may damage equipment and disrupt experiment result                                     |
| Check the RSS attenuation                               | This parameter will influence the area used to locate APs and UEs                                                                        |
| Measure the experiment area and locate APs on the field | In case if RSS is high enough there is no reason to use a smaller area because the radio link quality would remain the same              |

\section{Case-3. Sub-optimal layout}\label{case-3.-near-optimal-layout}

In the third case, the only changed things are the position of
\textbf{APs}.

Each of them now is put in the middle of each group of 3 UEs, therefore
they have the same distance to centers of each cluster.

This case expects to perform in the best signal quality and transmission rate.

Short summary:

- English issues - the quality can be improved (see my suggestions). Please try to use Subject + Verb + Object 1 + Object 2 + ... sentence structure.
- Maybe the structure can be modified a bit, as well as discussion at the end of 'experiment' section.
- Figures: it would much better if you use higher quality figures (at best vector figures) and also properly reference to them. Each figure or table should be explained.
- Scientific language issues
  - You should be more precise and specific (please avoid words good, perfect, bad etc.; give the concrete values or compare with something). Some statements are questionable. Please also avoid personal thoughts and try to justify every statement made.
  - Please use numbering for sections and subsections (and use more layers for the subsections - subsubsections and subsubsubsection etc.)
  - References are nearly not present. Please use bibtex and make references to work of others.
  - Glossaries is a nice package for LaTex. You can use it for abbreviations (some of them are not explained in text).

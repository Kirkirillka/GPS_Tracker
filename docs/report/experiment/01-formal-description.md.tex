\subsection{Main information}\label{main-information}

The main purpose of the experiment is to optimize the location of \glspl{access_point} in 
a such way that network throughput and \gls{rss} of \glspl{ue} is maximized.

For that we experiment with the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \gls{access_point} located in the space without any obstacles. They are surrounded by
  \glspl{ue}.
\item
  \glspl{ue} connect to \glspl{access_point}.\Gls{rss} and throughput are evaluated via specially
  designed experimental software.
\item
  \Glspl{ue} send messages to central server.
\item
  An operator has access to control interface, where he can analyze received data
  and run optimization algorithms to find out the best positions for \glspl{access_point}.
\item
  Once an better suggested position for \gls{access_point} is found, the \gls{access_point} will be moved there.
\item
  Experiment goes to the third step and repeats until no significant
  improvement regarding \gls{rss} and speed rate will be observed.
\end{enumerate}

The experiment repeated three times with different initial positions. Test sets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sub-optimal (\glspl{access_point} are surrounded by \glspl{ue}), described in Section \ref{case-1.-sub-optimal-layout}.
\item
Uniform (\glspl{access_point} has the same distance to \gls{command_n_center}), described in Section \ref{case-2.-uniform-layout}.  
\item
  Near-optimal (\glspl{access_point} are equidistant from \glspl{ue}  according to K-Means), described in Section \ref{case-3.-near-optimal-layout}.

\end{enumerate}

For each test case, we expect that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Minimization of the distance between \glspl{ue} and \glspl{access_point} will lead to \glspl{rss} gain and throughput increase.
\item
  The interference effect may be visible -- in the sub-optimal
  placements, it should decrease the throughput;
\end{enumerate}

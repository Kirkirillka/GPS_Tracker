\section{Formal Description of the
experiment}\label{formal-description-of-the-experiment}

In the experiment we seek to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Check the functionality of experimental software system.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  	\tightlist
  	\item
  	Check if the framework match initial functional properties.
  	\item
  	Test for stability, performance and usability in real case scenarios.
  \end{itemize}

\item
  Evaluation of \glspl{unmanned_aerial_vehicle} (having \gls{wifi} \glspl{access_point}) layout optimization algorithms.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  	\tightlist
  	\item
  	Evaluation for correctness of suggested positions for \glspl{uav}.
  	\item
  	Measurement of accuracy, stability and performance of the	optimization algorithms.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Main information}\label{main-information}

The main purpose of the experiment is to optimize the location of \glspl{access_point} in a such way that network throughput and \acrshort{rss} of \glspl{ue} is maximized.

For that, we design the experiment with the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \gls{ap} located in the space without any obstacles. They are surrounded by
  \glspl{ue}.
\item
  \glspl{ue} connect to \glspl{ap}. \acrshort{rss} and throughput are evaluated via specially designed experimental software.
\item
  \Glspl{ue} send messages to central server.
\item
  An operator has access to control interface, where he can analyze received data and run optimization algorithms to find out the best positions for \glspl{ap}.
\item
  Once an better suggested position for \gls{ap} is found, the \gls{ap} will be moved there.
\item
  Experiment goes to the third step and repeats until no significant improvement regarding \acrshort{rss} and speed rate will be observed.
\end{enumerate}

The experiment repeated three times with different initial positions. Test sets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
Near-Optimal (\glspl{ap} are equidistant from \glspl{ue}  according to K-Means), described in Section \ref{near-optimal-layout}.
\item
Uniform (\glspl{ap} has the same distance to \gls{command_n_center}), described in Section \ref{uniform-layout}.  
\item
Sub-Optimal (\glspl{ap} are surrounded by \glspl{ue}), described in Section \ref{sub-optimal-layout}.


\end{enumerate}

For each test case, we expect that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Minimization of the distance between \glspl{ue} and \glspl{ap} will lead to \glspl{rss} gain and throughput increase.
\item
  The interference effect may be visible - in the sub-optimal
  placements, it should decrease the throughput;
\end{enumerate}

  	scenarios.

  optimization algorithms.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  	\tightlist

  	Evaluation of correctness of provided optimized positions by the
  	algorithms.

\subsection{Main information}\label{main-information}

The main purpose of the experiment is to optimize the location of \gls{access_point}'s in 
a such way that throughput and RSS of UE's connected to those AP is
maximized.

For that we experiment with the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  APs located in the space without any obstacles. They are surrounded by
  UEs.
\item
  UEs connected to APs and evaluate RSS and throughput via specially
  designed software.
\item
  Stored measured records by UEs are sent/copied to the central server.
\item
  An operator uses the provided interface to analyze the measurements
  and run optimization algorithms to find out the best positions for
  APs.
\item
  After the next optimal positions for APs are found, access points
  moved to the optimized points.
\item
  An experiment is going to step 3 and repeated until no significant
  improvement for APs positions will be observed.
\end{enumerate}

The experiment repeated three times with different initial APs and UE
positions.

Test sets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Suboptimal (APs in between clusters)
\item
  Near-optimal (APs in clusters according to K-Means.)
\item
  Uniform (in the area)
\end{enumerate}

For each test case, we expect that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Minimization of the distance between UEs and APs will lead to RSS gain
  and throughput increase.
\item
  The interference effect may be visible -- in the suboptimal
  placements, it should decrease the throughput;
\end{enumerate}

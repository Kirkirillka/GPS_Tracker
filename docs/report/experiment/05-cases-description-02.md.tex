In the second case, we want to put the APs at the same distance and line
from the CnC.

Here, both \textbf{APs} is set right on the line between the quarter of
UEs and quarter where UE was alone.

Signal quality and transmission rate in this configuration expected to
decrease compared to the previous case.

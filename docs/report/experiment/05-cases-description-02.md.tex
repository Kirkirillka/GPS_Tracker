\section{Uniform layout}\label{uniform-layout}

In the uniform case layout, presented in Figure \ref{fig:uniform-case-layout}, we want to put \glspl{ap} at the same distance and line from \gls{command_n_center}.

Here, both \glspl{ap} are set right on the line between 1st and 3rd quarter and between 2nd and 4th quarter.

Signal quality and transmission rate in this configuration expected to increase compared with the \hyperref[near-optimal-layout]{Near-Optimal case}.

 Items:
 - 6 smartphones
 - 2 access points (AP): 3 smartphones connected to each
 - 1 control point (CP): 2 APs connected
 
 
  
  Suboptimal scheme was chosen to begin with:
  Smartphones connection to one AP was made successfully.
  But the second AP was connected to the other 3 smartphones with more effort.
  
  After some time of data collection it was clear that the second AP was not sending data at all, so we decided to locate devices according to the near-optimal scheme.
  
  But although the signal level increased a bit from -82 and -84 to -76 and -80, data still was collected only from the first AP.
  
  In addition, the graphical view in CP showed 4 smartphones in a group having approximately the same GPS coordinates, whereas the other 2 were detected much further.
  
  Then we figured out that the second AP stopped working at some time. But restarting it and devices reconnection did not help to obtain data of that 3 smartphones in CP

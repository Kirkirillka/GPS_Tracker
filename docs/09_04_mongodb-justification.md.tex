\subsection{Decision on the storage component -
MongoDB}\label{decision-on-the-storage-component---mongodb}

\subsubsection{Description}\label{description}

At the beginning of our group study it was clear all messages from UEs
must have been stored for further processing/representation graphically
in CnC.

We decided to use the NoSQL MongoDB database to store messages.

There were some \textbf{aspects} leading us in our way of choice:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the message structure changed as the project is growing
\item
  The JSON message type dictated by Python usage
\item
  availability is more important than consistency (ACID)
\item
  queries must be fast to collect and represent data in real-time
\item
  easy to integrate and use
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decision}\label{decision}

As a result, MongoDB was selected for the reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rustam has experience of using it
\item
  fits aspects listed above more than other databases
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Status}\label{status}

Accepted

\subsubsection{Consequences}\label{consequences}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The query language used in MongoDB is not SQL-compatible, required
  efforts to learn
\item
  There is not strict data schema, you can change the structure of
  message fields easily, but also it requires more checks for validity.
\end{itemize}

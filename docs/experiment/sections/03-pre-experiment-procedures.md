# 3. Pre-experiment procedures

In this section we specify the steps to be performed before the main part of experiment.

These steps influence experiment parameters. Our aim is to take into account environment conditions and to minimize noise component.

## Steps

| Step                                                    | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Check the weather                                       | Specific weather condition (such as snow or rain) may damage equipment and disrupt experiment result |
| Check the RSS attenuation                               | ???                                                                                                  |
| Measure the experiment area and locate APs on the field |                                                                                                      |

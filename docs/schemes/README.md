# Schemes and Diagrams

in this section, we put diagrams, schemes, images, which can help to understand how the system works, show its internals.

- **Conceptual Diagrams** ([here](conceptual)) - to show how the system in general works.
- **Architecture Diagrams** ([here](architecture)) - to show how the overall architecture of the project looks like, which
technologies have we chosen for the project.
- **Component Diagrams** ([here](components)) - to show how components are composed and connect to each other,
 which interfaces they use.
- **Class Diagrams** ([here](classes)) - to show what attributes and methods the classes have, how they are 
invoked and used.

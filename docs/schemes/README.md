# Schemes and plots

in this section, we put diagrams, schemes, images, which can help us understand how the system works, show its internals.

- **Architecture Diagram** ([here](components)) - to show how the overall achitecture of the project looks like, which
technologies have we chosen for the project.
- **Component Diagram** ([here](components/)) - to show how components are composed and connect to each other,
 which interfaces they use.

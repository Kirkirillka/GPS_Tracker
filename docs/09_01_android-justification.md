## Android Native Development

### Description

At the beginning of the group project development, it was said that a mobile app for client coordinates transfer would be necessary.

Although reasons were **against** selecting Android:

- nobody in our team has an experience developing using Android

### Decision

Eventually, we **agreed** upon designing the app on the Android platform based on the following reasons:

- two members of our team write on the Java language
- Android mobile operating system has the biggest share on the market
- large and developed community
- possibility to involve many UEs to the experiment

### Status

Accepted

### Consequences

- we have got an app which is easy to install and use
- minimum of 6 UEs took part in our experimental phase, not a problem to involve even more
- additional changes to the app may be easily done
- huge opportunities to evolve and enlarge the project

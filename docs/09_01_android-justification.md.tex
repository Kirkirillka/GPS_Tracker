\subsection{Android Native Development}\label{android-native-development}

\subsubsection{Description}\label{description}

At the beginning of the group project development, it said that a mobile
app for client coordinates transfer would be necessary.

Although reasons were \textbf{against} selecting Android:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  nobody in our team has an experience developing using Android
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decision}\label{decision}

Eventually, we \textbf{agreed} upon designing the app on the Android
platform based on the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  two members of our team write on the Java language
\item
  Android mobile operating system has the biggest share on the market
\item
  large and developed community
\item
  possibility to involve many UEs to the experiment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Status}\label{status}

Accepted

\subsubsection{Consequences}\label{consequences}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  we have got an app which is easy to install and use
\item
  minimum of 6 UEs took part in our experimental phase, not a problem to
  involve even more
\item
  additional changes to the app are easy to add
\item
  huge opportunities to evolve and enlarge the project
\end{itemize}
